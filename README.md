# Counterfeit Banknote Detection Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a reliable model for detecting counterfeit banknotes using machine learning techniques, focusing on Random Forest and Logistic Regression models. The dataset contains features such as Length, Left, Right, Bottom, Top, and Diagonal, along with labels indicating whether the banknote is genuine or counterfeit.

## Background
Creating a precise and dependable counterfeit detection system is crucial to safeguarding financial systems, businesses, and individuals from the significant threat posed by counterfeit banknotes. This initiative is essential for upholding the integrity of currency transactions and preventing financial fraud.

## Problem Statement
### Importance of the Project
- Counterfeit currency undermines trust in financial systems.
- Results in financial losses for businesses and individuals.
- Aids in preventing illegal activities related to counterfeit money.

### Understanding of the Problem
- Recognizing counterfeit banknotes is challenging due to the sophistication of counterfeiters.
- Traditional methods may not be sufficient, necessitating the use of machine learning for accurate detection.

## Models Used
### Logistic Regression
- Suitable for binary classification problems.
- Effective for distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit banknotes.

### Random Forest
- Flexible algorithm suitable for both classification and regression tasks.
- Resistant to overfitting and capable of managing intricate relationships in the data.
